# LLM Model Validation

Before setting up LLM calls, recommending models, or modifying LLM configuration code, you MUST verify that the model name is current and valid.

## Required Verification Steps

1. **Check official documentation** using web search before recommending any model:
   - OpenAI: Search for current model names at docs.openai.com
   - Anthropic: Search for current model names at docs.anthropic.com  
   - Google Gemini: Search for current model names at ai.google.dev

2. **Never assume model names** - Model names change frequently:
   - Models get deprecated (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo` -> `gpt-4o`)
   - Version formats change (e.g., `gemini-pro` -> `gemini-1.5-pro` -> `gemini-2.0-flash`)
   - Preview models expire (e.g., `gemini-3-flash-preview` may not exist)

3. **Verify fallback models too** - When implementing fallback logic, verify all model names in the fallback chain

## Example Verification

Before writing code like:
```python
DEFAULT_MODELS = {
    "openai": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "gemini": "gemini-2.5-flash",
}
```

First search: "OpenAI current model names 2026" and "Gemini current model names 2026"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using `gemini-2.5-flash` when it may be deprecated
- Using preview model names that have expired
- Assuming model naming conventions without checking
- Copying model names from old code examples

## When in Doubt

Ask the user: "Which specific model would you like to use? I can verify it exists in the current API."
